# 👋 Hi, I’m Shadab — I Build AI So You Don’t Have To

I spend an unhealthy amount of time making AI systems do things humans *should* probably do themselves.  
If it involves multi-agent chaos, LLM pipelines, data workflows, or convincing a model to behave, I’m there.


## 🚀 What I Actually Do  
- Build AI agents that argue with each other until they agree on an answer  
- Make LLMs behave like responsible adults  
- Translate human problems into Python problems  
- Pretend to “optimise inference cost” while actually rewriting the same code 17 times  
- Turn vague ideas into real products before anyone realises how complicated they are  


## 🧠 Real Skills (Not Just Buzzwords)  
**AI & ML:**  
LLMs, LangGraph, LangChain, Multi-Agent Systems, RAG, CLIP, FAISS, LSTM, CV  

**Backend:**  
FastAPI, Flask, Redis, JWT, Supabase/Appwrite  

**Other:**  
Breaking things, fixing them at 3 AM, and pretending it was intentional  


## 🔥 Project Highlights  

### **Curio – AI Co-Teacher**  
A smartboard assistant that basically does half the teaching. Teachers love it; students fear it.

### **AI Mock Interviewer**  
A system that asks better questions than most HR people and evaluates answers without bias or coffee breaks.

### **Advanced Research Agent**  
A multi-agent research pipeline that gathers info, fact-checks it, and writes a final report faster than your group project teammates.

### **ISL Translator**  
Real-time Indian Sign Language → text/speech translator.  
Because communication shouldn’t depend on luck.

### **GuideAI – Tourist Assistant**  
AI travel buddy that won’t ditch you halfway like your friends.


## 🏆 Achievements (Believe It or Not)  
- **Topper Award** for maintaining a 9.6 GPA  
- **Hackathon Winner** — built an AI solution while surviving zero hours of sleep  
- **AI Intern** — shipped real systems that didn’t crash (most of the time)  
- Active **NSS volunteer** — touched grass and helped humans
